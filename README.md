# Troubleshooting

A good basic troubleshooting step is to use `docker-compose down` and then `docker-compose up --build` to rebuild the app image; however, this will delete everything in the database.

## XMLSEC

If the build fails when pip tries to install xmlsec, the issue is usually missing libraries.

The xmlsec package includes instructions for installing the libraries on common platforms in the [documentation](https://github.com/mehcode/python-xmlsec/blob/master/README.rst#install)

## Line Endings

If the container builds but crashes or logs an error of unrecognized commands, the issue is usually incorrect line endings.

Most IDEs/Text Editors allow changing the line endings, but the dos2unix utility can also be used to change the line endings of `start-app.sh` and `start-server.sh` to LF.


# Update

To update an existing installation: 

1. Pull the latest changes using git

2. Restart the application using `docker-compose restart`

# Testing

To run the automated tests on the application run the command below

Test coverage information will be stored in an htmlcov directory

```bash
docker-compose --env-file .env run app sh -c "coverage run manage.py test && coverage html && flake8"
```

# Authentication

The environment variables `SP_PUBLIC_CERT`, `SP_PRIVATE_KEY` , and `SP_ENTITY_ID` must be defined (if using docker-compose the variables can be passed through).

Information on the settings for the authentication module can be found on the [OpenLXP-Authentication repo](https://github.com/OpenLXP/openlxp-authentication).


# Authorization

The setting `OPEN_ENDPOINTS` can be defined in the django settings file.
It is a list of strings (regex notation may be used) for URLs that should not check for authentication or authorization.
