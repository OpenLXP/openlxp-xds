# Enterprise Course Catalog: OPENLXP-XDS
The Experience Discovery Service (XDS) is the administration and configuration backend to the human-facing XDS application, enabling an Experience Consumer or Experience Facilitator to quickly locate a pertinent learning experience metadata record that has been indexed by the Experience Index Service (XIS). Because the XDS is a separate application, it can be deployed in a separate environment from the XIS. It can even be configured to point to a different XIS and Experience Search engine (XSE) as needed. In addition, multiple XDS applications can be deployed and point to the same XIS, allowing for excellent installation and configuration flexibility.

## Prerequisites
### Install Docker & docker-compose
#### Windows & MacOS
- Download and install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) (docker compose included)


#### Linux
You can download Docker Compose binaries from the

## 6. Removing Deployment
To destroy the created resources, simply run the command below in your terminal:
    
    
    docker compose down

## Troubleshooting
- If the container builds but crashes or logs an error of unrecognized commands, the issue is usually incorrect line endings. Most IDEs/Text Editors allow changing the line endings, but the dos2unix utility can also be used to change the line endings of `start-app.sh` and `start-server.sh` to LF.


- A good basic troubleshooting step is to use `docker-compose down` and then `docker-compose up --build` to rebuild the app image; however, this will delete everything in the database.

- XMLSEC
    - If the build fails when pip tries to install xmlsec, the issue is usually missing libraries.

    - The xmlsec package includes instructions for installing the libraries on common platforms in the [documentation](https://github.com/mehcode/python-xmlsec/blob/master/README.rst#install)


## Update

To update an existing installation: 

1. Pull the latest changes using git

2. Restart the application using `docker-compose restart`

## Testing

To run the automated tests on the application run the command below

Test coverage information will be stored in an htmlcov directory

```bash
docker-compose --env-file .env run app sh -c "coverage run manage.py test && coverage html && flake8"
```

## Authentication

The environment variables `SP_PUBLIC_CERT`, `SP_PRIVATE_KEY` , and `SP_ENTITY_ID` must be defined (if using docker-compose the variables can be passed through).

Information on the settings for the authentication module can be found on the [OpenLXP-Authentication repo](https://github.com/OpenLXP/openlxp-authentication).


## Authorization

The setting `OPEN_ENDPOINTS` can be defined in the django settings file.
It is a list of strings (regex notation may be used) for URLs that should not check for authentication or authorization.
